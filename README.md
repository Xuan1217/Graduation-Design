# Graduation-Design
Here is the Graduation Design for 2024 Leeds graduation!

## The introduction of this project
This project is reproduced by [SpectralNet Resource](https://github.com/kstant0725/SpectralNet)
And just use this model to do some experiment.
Tips: This is Pytorch version


## Here are structure of this portfoilo
```
Other Normal Algorithm
SpectralNet
environment.yml
```

The `environment.yml` file is configuration of the virtual environment. It is suitable for all code in this project.

In `Other Normal Algorithm`, there are some .py file which could execute the Basic K-means algorithm and spectral clustering algorithm by sk-learn library. If you want to use these codes to do something, you should enter these file and programme the code which could load your dataset.

In `SpectralNet` is the model. You could run this project by command `python main.py config/` + any config file.
